# ecosdata

An R project for scraping endangered species documents and data from ECOS.

## Purpose

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) maintains the
[ECOS website](http://ecos.fws.gov) as a resource for information and documents
about species listed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). While useful in 
some ways, there is much more that can be done with all of the data that is 
provided by ECOS. This R project contains a set of scripts to scrape data and
documents from ECOS, regularly check for data and document updates, and manage
the data.

This is an "analysis package," i.e., an R package focused on analysis with the 
.Rmd vignettes as analysis scripts. The advantages (from our POV) of creating an
analysis package rather than plain R scripts are (a) familiar file structure and
(b) ease of documentation. 

## Questions
