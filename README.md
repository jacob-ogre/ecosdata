# ecosdata

An R project for scraping data from ECOS.

## Purpose

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) maintains the
[ECOS website](http://ecos.fws.gov) as a resource for information and documents
about species listed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). While useful in 
some ways, there is much more that can be done with all of the data that is 
provided by ECOS. This R project contains a set of scripts to scrape data and
documents from ECOS, regularly check for data and document updates, and manage
the data.

## Questions

Have questions about these scripts? Want to contribute? Submit
