\title{Get a summary data.frame of an ECOS page scrape}
\usage{
get_species_page_summary_(url, species, pause = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{url}{The url of the species page}

\item{species}{The scientific name of the species}

\item{pause}{Pause for 0.5-3s during scraping [default = TRUE]}
}
\description{
Note the trailing underscore, to separate from
\link[ecosscraper]{get_species_page_summary}
}
\details{
By default, \code{get_species_page_summary} will fetch the species' ECOS page
given the URL, but there may be times when the page has already been fetched.
In those cases, the page can be specified to save time.
}
\note{
Apparently, FWS does not serve the same version of a species' page up
twice in a row. Instead, the same information will be presented in different
orders. We have to use \code{strsplit} along with \link[stringr]{str_trim} to
get clean lines, then sort before doing the MD5 hash.
