While useful in \nsome ways, there is much more that can be done with all of the data that is \nprovided by ECOS. This R project contains a set of scripts to scrape data and\ndocuments from ECOS, regularly check for data and document updates, and manage\nthe data.\n\n## Questions\n\nHave questions about these scripts? Want to contribute? Submit \n[an issue here](https://github.com/jacob-ogre/ecosdata) or \n[get in touch](mailto:esa@defenders.org).\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under a BSD 2-clause open source license.
